•In the fall of our final year, our mood changed. The relaxed atmosphere had disappeared, and the peer group pressure to work hard was strong. Meanwhile, at the back of everyone's mind was what we would do next after graduation. As for me, I wanted to travel, and I wanted to be a writer. I braced myself for some resistance to the idea from my father, who wanted me to go to law school, and follow his path through life. 

•However, he supported what I wanted but he made me think about it by watching the crabs. The cage was full of crabs. One of them was trying to escape, but each time it reached the top the other crabs pulled it back. In the end it gave up lengthy struggle to escape and started to prevent other crabs from escaping. By watching crabs, my father told me not to be pulled back by others, and to get to know oneself better.

I can still remember the men who built the house. The master from the manor house found a clearing in the huge orchard which ran up and down the hills. I only see my neighbour side-on. I’ve never seen him from the front. Apart from the autumn, the groundsman brought a young woman home. I was filled with the sound of conversation and laughter. The woman looked after the garden around me, there was a riot of colours. With time going by, they had children and then grew up. But one day, I saw a postman arrive with a bundle of letters, the woman cried out and fainted. Years later, they left without saying goodbye to me. 

Two middle-aged women spent several years here. I like them because they kept everything spick and span. The last person lived with me working at home assembling furniture. We just kept each other company. He walked very slowly using his hands to steady himself. 

As time passed, there are traces of everyone who has lived with me. However, there are my golden memories.  But in fact, I look and feel my age.

• Homesickness was traditionally experienced by American children during the long summer vacation when they received convenient childcare which was idealized by the parents as being great “fun”, while British children experienced homesickness at an even earlier age, when sons of the aristocracy were sent to boarding school at the age of seven. Nowadays, homesickness is usually first experienced by teenagers who leave home and go to college. 

• Then, what is homesickness? Is homesickness just associated with a lack of maturity? Actually, the modern term “homesickness” was coined in the 17th century to describe the feelings of Swiss mercenaries who missed their homeland while fighting elsewhere in Europe. In the18th and 19th century, people especially women who missed their home were even considered virtuous. 

• British actors in Hollywood, sportsmen on long tours abroad, soldiers serving in foreign wars, business travellers and as well as the author all admit how they suffer from and deal with extreme homesickness. In the recent years, people are more willing to talk about homesickness and it is believed that acknowledging homesickness may help avoid the risk of anxiety and depression. Therefore, instead of being immature or something to be ashamed of, homesickness is both a painful longing to be back home, and an extremely common occurrence.

•The writer uses stories about doing business between Swedes and Saudis to illustrate the differences between an individualist and a collectivist approach to business. They have different concepts of the role of personal relationships in business. The Swedes believe the business is done with a company while the Saudis think it should be done with a person they know and trust. Then the writer compares the characteristics of the collectivist and those of the individualist. 

•In most collectivist societies, the families are usually extended families while in the individualist societies, nuclear families are prevalent. People consider themselves as part of a “we” group or in-group in the collectivist societies. In contrast, the individualists think of themselves as “I”, their personal identity which is distinct from other peoples’. A practical and psychological dependence relationship develops between the person and the in-group in the collectivist societies. However, rarely do people depend on a group in the individualist societies.

•There is concern among the Chinese scholars and students that Christmas has an increasing impact on the Chinese culture. Due to the changes in the past two decades, we Chinese do seem to attach a lot more attention to Christmas today than we did in the past. 

•In fact, be it in China or in the West, a festival carries the same meaning featured by celebrations, a feast or humble  meal, relaxation and a break from the skulduggery or the mundane affairs. 

•However, no one can be left untouched by the festivals in the Gregorian  calendar though we follow the lunar calendar. The festive spirit of the West has influenced us. 

•The fear of the impact of the decadence of the West on the Chinese culture is not well grounded, as no culture in the world is free of decadence. Consequently, we Chinese should not follow the West blindly, but accept the goodness the Western festivals offer and practice what they stand for.
