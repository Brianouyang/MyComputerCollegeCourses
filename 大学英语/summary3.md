U1 2 We are all dying

Life is short and we don't know whether we will be in coffin dwellers or become ash. So we shouldn't putt our dreams on the back burner. We should make the best of our short life and enrich our life. Therefore, when the reaper arrives, we’ve achieved so much that we wouldn't regret.
生命是短暂的，我们不知道我们是否会在棺材或成为灰烬。所以我们不应该把我们的梦想放一边。我们应该充分利用我们短暂的生命，丰富我们的生活。因此，当死神来临时，我们得到了很多，不会后悔。
