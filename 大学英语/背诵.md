## **Catching crabs**

1 In the fall of our final year, our mood changed. The relaxed atmosphere of the preceding summer semester, the impromptu ball games, the boating on the Charles River, the late-night parties had disappeared, and we all started to get our heads down, studying late, and attendance at classes rose steeply again. We all sensed we were coming to the end of our stay here, that we would never get a chance like this again, and we became determined not to waste it. Most important of course were the final exams in April and May in the following year. No one wanted the humiliation of finishing last in class, so the peer group pressure to work hard was strong. Libraries which were once empty after five o'clock in the afternoon were standing room only until the early hours of the morning, and guys wore the bags under their eyes and their pale, sleepy faces with pride, like medals proving their diligence.

1 大学最后一年的秋天，我们的心情变了。刚刚过去的夏季学期的轻松氛围、即兴球赛、查尔斯河上的泛舟以及深夜晚会都不见了踪影，我们开始埋头学习，苦读到深夜，课堂出勤率再次急剧上升。我们都觉得在校时间不多了，以后再也不会有这样的学习机会了，所以都下定决心不再虚度光阴。当然，下一年四五月份的期末考试最为重要。我们谁都不想考全班倒数第一，那也太丢人了，因此同学们之间的竞争压力特别大。以前每天下午五点以后，图书馆就空无一人了，现在却要等到天快亮时才会有空座，大家熬夜熬出了眼袋，脸色苍白，睡眼惺忪，却很自豪，好像这些都是表彰他们勤奋好学的奖章。

2 But there was something else. At the back of everyone's mind was what we would do next, when we left university in a few months' time. It wasn't always the high-flyers with the top grades who knew what they were going to do. Quite often it was the quieter, less impressive students who had the next stages of their life mapped out. One had landed a job in his brother's advertising firm in Madison Avenue, another had got a script under provisional acceptance in Hollywood. The most ambitious student among us was going to work as a party activist at a local level. We all saw him ending up in Congress one day. But most people were either looking to continue their studies, or to make a living with a white-collar job in a bank, local government, or anything which would pay them enough to have a comfortable time in their early twenties, and then settle down with a family, a mortgage and some hope of promotion.

2 还有别的事情让大家心情焦虑。每个人都在心里盘算着过几个月毕业离校之后该找份什么样的工作。并不总是那些心怀抱负、成绩拔尖的高材生才清楚自己将来要做什么，常常是那些平日里默默无闻的同学早早为自己人生的下几个阶段做好了规划。有位同学在位于麦迪逊大道他哥哥的广告公司得到了一份工作，另一位同学写的电影脚本已经与好莱坞草签了合约。我们当中野心最大的一位同学准备到地方上当一个政党活动家，我们都预料他最终会当上国会议员。但大多数同学不是准备继续深造，就是想在银行、地方政府或其他单位当个白领，薪水足够多，让他们得以在二十出头的时候过上舒适的生活，然后就娶妻生子，贷款买房，期望升职，过安稳日子。

## **Cultural childhoods**

10 Social anthropologists ask questions about how childhood, and the role of children, is seen within the communities they study, rather than how it fits into Western ideas about childhood. By doing this they seek to avoid imposing outside ideas onto people with very different understandings of the world or making value judgments on other people's ways of raising their children. While Westerners might take exception to eight-year-old girls working or to 12-year-old girls marrying, within their own communities such activities are seen as a normal and positive part of childhood. Indeed, seen through the eyes of non-Westerners, many "normal" Western childcare practices are seen as extremely bizarre and possibly harmful to children. Placing children in rooms of their own, refusing to feed them on demand, or letting them cry rather than immediately tending to them, are viewed very negatively in many societies and lead some to think that Westerners don't know how to look after children properly.

10 社会人类学家探寻的是在他们所研究的族群里人们是如何看待童年，以及儿童扮演的角色问题，而不是研究那些地区的童年观是否符合西方的观念。他们这么做是为了避免把外界的观念强加给那些持不同世界观的人身上，或者是为了避免对其他民族养育孩子的方式作价值观方面的判断。西方人可能会反对八岁的女孩儿打工，反对12岁的女孩儿结婚，但在他们自己的族群里，这些事情被视为童年生活的一个积极的常态。的确，在非西方人看来，许多“正常的”西方育儿方式极其怪异，可能对孩子是有害的。让孩子在自己的屋里呆着，想吃东西的时候不给他们吃，或者任由他们哭闹而不赶快去安抚他们，这些在很多社会里都是不对的事情，会让人觉得西方人根本不懂得如何照看孩子。

11 Childhood is a changing social phenomenon, of continual fascination and concern. Looking at it from a cross-cultural perspective shows the wide variety of childhoods that exist across the world and warns against interfering in or criticizing people whose lives, and understandings of the world, are very different to our own. All societies recognize that children are different to adults and have particular qualities and needs; what anthropologists and other social scientists are interested in are the ideas that each society has about the nature of childhood and the impact these views have on children's lives.

11 童年是一种处于变化之中的社会现象，具有持续的吸引力，并且不断受到关注。从跨文化角度来看待这个问题能展示出世界上各种各样的童年生活，并警示我们不要随意干涉或指责那些生活方式及世界观跟我们不一样的人。所有的社会都承认儿童和成年人是不同的，他们有自己独特的品性和需求；人类学家和社会科学家感兴趣的是每个社会对儿童的天性都有什么样的看法，以及这些看法会如何影响儿童的生活。

## **How we listen**

11 Perhaps an analogy with what happens to us when we visit the theater will make this instinctive correlation clearer. In the theater, you are aware of the actors and actresses, costumes and sets, sounds and movements. All these give one the sense that the theater is a pleasant place to be in. They constitute the sensuous plane in our theatrical reactions.

11 也许，用去剧院看戏时我们做了什么来作类比，能使这种本能的联系更加明白易懂。在剧院里，你能注意到男女演员、服装和布景、声音和动作。这些东西组合在一起，会让我们觉得剧院是一个令人愉悦的地方，它们构成了我们欣赏戏剧的感官层次。

12 The expressive plane in the theater would be derived from the feeling that you get from what is happening on the stage. You are moved to pity, excitement, or gaiety. It is this general feeling, generated aside from the particular words being spoken, a certain emotional something which exists on the stage, that is analogous to the expressive quality in music.

12 戏剧的表现层次来自于你看舞台表演时获得的感受。它激起你的怜悯、兴奋或是愉悦。正是这种笼统的感觉，除了听台词所感受到的，主要是存在于舞台上的某种情感的东西，与音乐的表现性相类似。

13 The plot and plot development is equivalent to our sheerly musical plane. The playwright creates and develops a character in just the same way that a composer creates and develops a theme. According to the degree of your awareness of the way in which the artist in either field handles his material will you become a more intelligent listener.

13 剧情以及剧情的发展相当于我们所说的纯音乐层次。剧作家塑造和发展戏剧人物的方式，和作曲家创造和发展主题的方式是一样的。你能否成为一个聪明的听众，取决于你对剧作家或音乐家处理艺术材料的手段的了解有多深。

14 It is easy enough to see that the theatergoer never is conscious of any of these elements separately. He is aware of them all at the same time. The same is true of music listening. We simultaneously and without thinking listen on all three planes.

14 显然，看戏的人从来就不会单独注意到这其中的一个元素。他是同时注意到了一切。听音乐的道理也是一样的，我们同时地、不假思索地在三个层次上倾听音乐。

## **Golden memories**

3 The groundsman tended the orchards and the gardens around the manor house, so the trees in autumn were always bowed down with apples and pears, and as the days grew shorter the land around was teeming with helpers picking the fruit and rounding up the windfalls to take to the manor house, or to market in town down the way.

3 园丁精心地照料庄园周围的果园和花园，所以到了秋天，树上总是果实累累，结满了苹果和梨。当白天越来越短的时候，四周的土地上全是一片忙碌的景象，帮工们采摘水果，并把地上被风吹落的水果集中起来，然后送到庄园或是沿着那条路运到镇上的市场去卖。

4 Apart from the autumn, it was quiet here, and the groundsman seemed forlorn until one day, he brought a young woman home. I was soon filled with the sounds of conversation and laughter, and the smell of cooking. While the groundsman was at work on the estate, the woman tended the garden around me, planting roses, daffodils and tulips, summer plants and chrysanthemums. There was a riot of colours, from blossom tinged with pink in early spring to the dark golden colours of late autumn. It felt good to look after the happy couple.

4 除了秋天，其他时候这里非常安静。园丁好像很孤独，直到后来有一天，他带了一名年轻女子回家。房子里很快充满了欢声笑语和饭菜的香味。园丁在庄园干活的时候，他的妻子会照看我周围的花园，种玫瑰、水仙和郁金香，还有夏季植物和菊花。从早春淡粉色的鲜花到深秋的深黄色的叶子，花园里真是五彩缤纷。能照看这样一对幸福的夫妇，我感觉很不错。

5 Soon there were children to look after too, first a girl, who gurgled happily and slept deeply, and then a boy with powerful lungs, who kept us all awake. But both were content and well-behaved. They played quietly together inside or in the garden, and gradually grew older and taller. One of my happiest memories is of one warm summer's day. High up in the topmost bough of one of the apple trees rested the boy, reading his favourite book.

5 没过多久，又有孩子要照看了。头一个孩子是女孩，她常常高兴得咯咯笑，睡得也很沉。后来又添了一个男孩，他哭起来嗓门很大，让我们大家晚上都睡不好觉。但是他们都很快乐，也很听话。他们会静静地在屋里或花园里一起玩耍。渐渐地，他们长大了，也长高了。最让我感到愉快的记忆是：在一个温暖的夏日，我看到男孩高高地坐在一棵苹果树的枝干上，读着他最喜爱的那本书。

## **I, we, they**

5 The vast majority of people in our world live in societies in which the interest of the group prevails over the interest of the individual. I will call these societies collectivist, using a word which to some readers may have political connotations, but it is not meant here in any political sense. It does not refer to the power of the state over the individual but to the power of the group. The first group in our lives is always the family into which we are born. Family structures, however, differ between societies. In most collectivist societies the "family" within which the child grows up consists of a number of people living closely together; not just the parents and other children, but, for example, grandparents, uncles, aunts, servants, or other housemates. This is known in cultural anthropology as the extended family. When children grow up they learn to think of themselves as part of a "we" group, a relationship which is not voluntary but given by nature. The "we" group is distinct from other people in society who belong to "they" groups, of which there are many. The "we" group (or in-group) is the major source of one's identity, and the only secure protection one has against the hardships of life. Therefore one owes lifelong loyalty to one's in-group, and breaking this loyalty is one of the worst things a person can do. Between the person and the in-group a dependence relationship develops which is both practical and psychological.

5 世界上大多数人都生活在团体利益大于个人利益的社会里, 我把这类社会称作集体主义社会，集体主义这个词在某些读者看来具有政治意义，但我在使用这个词时不带任何政治色彩。它并不是指国家权力对个人的压制，而是特指团体的力量。我们生命中的第一个团体向来都是我们出生的那个家庭。但不同社会有着不同的家庭结构。在大多数集体主义社会里，小孩子成长的“家庭”有许多人生活在一起；有父母，有兄弟姐妹，还有比如爷爷、奶奶、叔伯、姑姑、佣人及其他的家庭成员。这种家庭在文化人类学上被称为扩展型家庭。小孩在成长的过程中就学着把自己看作是“我们”团体中的一员，这种关系并不是出于个人的选择，而是与生俱来的。“我们”团体不同于社会上众多隶属“他们”团体里的他者。“我们”团体（或内部团体）是个人认同感的主要来源，是个人应对生活艰辛所能依赖的唯一的安全保障。所以每个人一生都忠于自己的内部团体，而背叛这个团体是个人所能犯下的最严重的错误。个人和内部团体之间会逐渐建立起一种相互依存的关系，这种关系既有实用价值，又能给人心理上的依靠。

6 A minority of people in our world live in societies in which the interests of the individual prevail over the interests of the group, societies which I will call individualist. In these, most children are born into families consisting of two parents and, possibly, other children; in some societies there is an increasing share of one-parent families. Other relatives live elsewhere and are rarely seen. This type is the nuclear family (from the Latin "nucleus" meaning core). Children from such families, as they grow up, soon learn to think of themselves as "I". This "I", their personal identity, is distinct from other people's "I"s, and these others are not classified according to their group membership but to individual characteristics. Playmates, for example, are chosen on the basis of personal preferences. The purpose of education is to enable the child to stand on its own feet. The child is expected to leave the parental home as soon as this has been achieved. Not infrequently, children, after having left home, reduce relationships with their parents to a minimum or break them off altogether. Neither practically nor psychologically is the healthy person in this type of society supposed to be dependent on a group.

6 世界上还有少数人生活在个人利益大于团体利益的社会里，我把这类社会称为个人主义社会。在这类社会中，多数小孩出生在由父母和孩子组成的家庭里，当然，可能还会有兄弟姐妹；在某些社会中，单亲家庭的数量呈逐渐上升的趋势。其他的亲戚住在别处，彼此很少见面。这类家庭被称为核心家庭（源于拉丁词nucleus，意为“核心”）。核心家庭里的孩子在成长过程中，很快就学会把自己看成是“我”。这个“我”——即他们的个人身份——区别于其他人的“我”，而且这所谓的其他人并不是以不同团体的成员身份来区别的，而是以个人特点来分类的。例如玩伴是根据个人的喜好来选择的。教育的目标是使孩子最终能自立。孩子一旦有了自立的能力，父母就会鼓励他们离开家。孩子离开父母家后，与父母的往来频率通常会降至最低点，或者完全断绝往来。在这类社会里，一个健全的人无论在实际生活中还是在心理上都不会依赖一个团体。

## **Chinese or Western, it's a time to relax**

10 We cannot afford to be left untouched by the festive spirit of the West, which doesn't mean we follow the West blindly. Not everything about their culture may be good, but decadence is not the sole preserve of the West. No culture in the world is free of decadence and that includes Chinese culture.

10 对于西方的节日气氛无动于衷，这我们做不到，但这也并不意味着我们要盲目跟风。西方文化不全都是好的，但同时，颓废的东西也不是西方文化所独有的。世界上没有一种文化能免于颓废，中国文化也不例外。

11 So the problem is not Western culture, or what we generally associate with it. The problem is those who are blinded by everything Western. We have to find out why more and more Chinese, especially the youngsters, feel at one with Western festivals as much as they do with the Chinese ones. But thankfully our festivals have lost none of their charm. And here is where the alarm bells sounded by scholars and students come in.

11 所以，问题并不在于西方文化，也不在于那些我们通常和西方文化联系在一起的东西。问题出在那些唯西方马首是瞻的人身上。为什么越来越多的中国人，尤其是中国的年轻人，对于西方节日和中国节日一样怡然自得，我们应该找出其中的原因。好在我们自己的节日并没有失去它们的风采。而正是因为担心这一点，我们的学者和学生们敲响了警钟。

12 I can understand the zeal of these people. They want to conserve our culture, and that definitely doesn't make them what we generally refer to as "conservatives". They have a point. But they, or for that matter anybody else, cannot save any society from the influence of a world getting smaller by the day.

12 我能够理解这些人的热情。他们想保护我们的文化，但绝对不能因为这一点就认为他们是我们通常所说的保守派。他们的观点有一定的道理。但是在这件事情上，他们和其他人一样，无法使任何社会免受日益变小的世界的影响。

13 So instead of trying to shut our eyes and ears to Western festivals, we should accept the goodness they offer and practise what they stand for. And let's not forget that Jesus was not born in the West but the East (the Middle East, to be precise), and he preached love for mankind and help for the poor.

13 所以，我们不应该对西方的节日视而不见、充耳不闻，相反，我们应该取其精华，去实践这些节日所倡导的德行。我们不要忘了，耶稣诞生于东方（确切地说，是中东），而不是在西方，我们也应该记住他要我们热爱全人类，扶贫助弱。
